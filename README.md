## Project Intro/Objective
The project aims is to detect properties damaged by a hurricane using low-quality satellite photos.
One of the main characteristics of this project is that we train a small amount of data and test a much bigger one.

### Techniques Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Supervised Machine Learning
* Callback Functions
* Training Neural Networks with different models
* CNN/ Resnet50 / Resnet Tuning / Mobile Net Model / Mobile Net Model Tunning / Droout
* Layer Manipulation
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

## Project Description
We We were given a dataset of pictures, after we manipulate the data we start training the model with different approaches. 
First, we try data augmentation in order to improve our training set. We analyze the results with a basic CNN model and we analyze how the different augmentations affect the model accuracy.
After we start testing different models to test their accuracy. We add layers, we manipulate them in different ways.
Once we try different models we create a DF to make a ranking of the different techniques
